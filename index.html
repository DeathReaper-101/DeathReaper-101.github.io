    <h1>Welcome to my 1st html</h1>
    <p>This is techinaically my 1st html site made from scratch because this program is forcing us to do this against our free will, but might as well
     </p>
    <p>Anyways this as a heads up this page is the main page where everything is linked 
     </p>
    <p>The links above on the page will have info on me, a way to contact me, my resume, and our project which you'll have to click on to know what it is.
     </p>
    <p>This is my homework for computer science class which will hopefully turn out all right
