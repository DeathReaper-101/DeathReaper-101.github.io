     <h1>Welcome To My About Me Page
     </h1>
    <h3>This page also includes stuff like interests, hobbies, as well as other things about me
     </h3>
     <p>I was born in Berkeley and I'm the oldest among my siblings.  I was raised in Oakland practically all of my life.  <br>My ethnicity can be classified as a latino and recently turned 15 years. I currently attend Envision Academy of<br> Arts and Technology. I also happen to be attending smash at UC Berkeley which is good for my future since I'm deciding to attend college. </p>
     <p>I enjoy a <em>lot of different types</em> (not all though) of anime and <br> here are some of my favorite anime genres
      </p>
     <ul>
         <li>Horror</li>
         <li>Shonen</li>
         <li>Comedy</li>
         <li>Fantasy</li>
         <li>Romance</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Anime has that unique feeling when you watch your favorite genre which is weird to explain, but let's just leave it at me liking it.<br> I'm good at the art of photography as well as photoshoping them which go well with each other. Some hobbies that I have include<br> things that have to do with being active or using your head. I want to learn everything I can so that I have options open for me in <br>the future in case I don't or can't achieve the goal that I was pursing. </p>
    <p>I prefer to be anonymous in everything which explains the picture and the following things
